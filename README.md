# Basic Webserver

The webserver is implemented by the HTTP specification as defined in 199* which can be found [here](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616). This repository consists of a simple webserver with only minor support of http features.

The goal of the project was to build a thread safe, memory efficient and fast as well as secure webserver by considering good practices and common safety concepts.

# basic Webserver

The webserver is implemented by the HTTP  specification as defined in 199* and can be found [here](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/HTTP2.html) and [here](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616), which is simpler and features less complex capabilities which aren't included in a "basic" webserver anyways.
